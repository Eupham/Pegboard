The purpose of this document is to outline the plan for the project, which includes key milestones, deliverables, and timelines. The project is intended to develop an Enterprise Information System (EIS) using Rust and Redis, with an initial prototype planned for December 2023. The plan is divided into four main stages: initiation, analysis, design, and implementation.

During the initiation stage, the project team will conduct a business needs assessment, create a project charter and scope documents, identify stakeholders and establish communication plans, perform a high-level feasibility analysis, and develop a project plan and timeline.

During the analysis stage, the team will map current processes, analyze and model data, create business requirements documentation, perform a gap analysis, create user personas and user stories, and develop technical requirements documentation.

During the design stage, the team will design the system architecture, user interface, data schema, entity-relationship diagram (ERD), database schema and query, module configuration, and integration design.

During the implementation stage, the team will customize the system, create user training documentation, migrate data, perform integration testing, develop a go-live plan and implementation schedule, and perform a post-implementation review and documentation.

Overall, this plan provides a roadmap for the project and ensures that all stakeholders are aligned on the project goals and timeline. The plan will be regularly reviewed and updated throughout the project lifecycle to ensure that it remains on track to meet its objectives.
