This document outlines the feasibility study for the development of an open-source Enterprise Information System (EIS) using Rust and Redis. The goal of this study is to determine if the development of such a system is possible given the current constraints, including the lack of funding for core features. The study will also assess the potential impact and benefits of the proposed system on businesses and users, and identify any potential risks or challenges that may arise during development.

The feasibility study for the development of an open-source EIS using Rust and Redis will be conducted in four phases:

    Technical feasibility: This phase will assess the technical feasibility of the project by evaluating the available tools, technologies, and resources needed to develop the system. This will include evaluating the performance and scalability of Rust and Redis, as well as assessing the development environment and tools needed for the project.

    Economic feasibility: This phase will assess the economic feasibility of the project by evaluating the costs associated with developing the system. This will include analyzing the costs of hardware, software, and other resources needed for development, as well as evaluating the potential revenue streams and funding sources for the project.

    Operational feasibility: This phase will assess the operational feasibility of the project by evaluating the potential impact and benefits of the proposed system on businesses and users. This will include analyzing the current business processes and identifying areas for improvement, as well as assessing the user requirements and needs for the system.

    Legal and regulatory feasibility: This phase will assess the legal and regulatory feasibility of the project by evaluating the open-source licensing requirements, intellectual property rights, and any other legal or regulatory considerations that may arise during development.

The feasibility study will provide a comprehensive assessment of the proposed open-source EIS, and will identify any potential risks, challenges, and opportunities that may arise during development. This study will inform the development and implementation of the system, and will help ensure its success in providing a scalable, efficient, and user-friendly solution for businesses.
