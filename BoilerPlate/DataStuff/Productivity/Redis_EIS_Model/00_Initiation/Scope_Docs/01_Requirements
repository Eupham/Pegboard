This document outlines the specific requirements that the Enterprise Information System (EIS) must meet in order to achieve the project objectives. The requirements are designed to ensure that the EIS is scalable, efficient, and user-friendly, while providing critical data and streamlining business processes.

The requirements for the EIS will be designed to meet the needs of businesses by providing a comprehensive set of features and functionality. This will include the ability to manage and access data, support for various user roles and permissions, and integration with external systems. The system will also be scalable to support enterprise-level operations, and will provide real-time data analysis and reporting capabilities. Additionally, the system must be user-friendly and intuitive, with a clear and consistent interface that can be easily navigated by users. Finally, the initial iterations of the system will be designed in Python before finalizing the end requirements for the Rust and Redis implementation.
