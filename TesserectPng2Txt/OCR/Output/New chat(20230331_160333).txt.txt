Before running the script, ensure you have the
specified OCR root folder (*${HOME}/OCR ")
with Input, Output, and Subs subfolders. If
these folders exist, the script will process all
JPEG images in the Input folder, save
intermediate TIF images to the Subs folder,
and create datetime-stamped text files in the
Output folder for each image. If any of the
folders are missing, the script will exit without

performing the conversion process.
