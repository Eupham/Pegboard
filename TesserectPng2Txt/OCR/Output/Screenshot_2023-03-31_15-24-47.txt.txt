. Took a screenshot testing

Great! Here's what you can do to process the screenshot using the script:

1. Save the screenshot in PNG format.
2. Move the PNG file to the input folder of the script. By default, the input folder s located at
" ${HOME} /Pegboard/TesserectPng2Txt /OCR/Input/ .

Open the terminal and navigate to the location of the script.

Make the script executable using the command *chmod +x tesserect_:
Run the script using the command * . /tesserect_io_folders.sh".

]

Wait for the script to finish processing the image. The recognized text will be saved in the
output folder of the script. By default, the output folder is located at  $ {HOME} /Pegboard

/TesserectPng2Txt /OCR/Output /" .

That's it! The script should be able to extract the text from the screenshot and save it in a text
file.
